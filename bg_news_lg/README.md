# ü™ê spaCy Project: Part-of-speech Tagging & Dependency Parsing (Universal Dependencies)

This project lets you train a part-of-speech tagger, morphologizer, lemmatizer and dependency parser from a [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/) corpus. It takes care of downloading the treebank, converting it to spaCy's format and training and evaluating the model. The template uses the [`UD_Bulgarian-BTB`](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Bulgarian-BTB) treebank by default, but you can swap it out for any other available treebank.
